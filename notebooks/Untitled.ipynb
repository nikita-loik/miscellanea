    "\n",
    "For the fair coin the expected number of heads at 20 tosses is 10, and at 40 tosses it is 20. For the binomial distribution the standard deviation at 20 tosses is approximately 2, and for 40 tosses it is 3. Which means that for both cases the results we are getting are within 1 standard diviation, and the probability that the coin is unbiased is about 70%.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we look at it into details, it suggest that for this result Coin A has to have the Expected probability of showing heads about 60% and Coin B 57.5%. This suggests that Coin A may be more biased towards heads. This, however requires verification using larger sample size.\n",

    "If we assume Poisson distribution with mean of 5 Dragons per match, we can expect total of 12 dragons or more appearing over 3 matches with the probability more than 80%. Which technically makes it possible to kill at least 12 Dragons over 3 matches.\n",
